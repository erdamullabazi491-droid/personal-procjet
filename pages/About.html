            <p></p><p>I was always labeld as troublemaker in school beacase i loved to ask alot of questions.
                my curiosity often got me in trouble but it also helped me learn more and more about music and instruments
                and thats when i realized something music is not just a song or a hobby but it was something more deep 
                a world full of emotions and new songs new beats just waiting to be discoverd and even though i was told that music
                was dumb and not a real career i still persued it and now here i am running a music store with my incredible 
                team helping others find their own love for music wether it is learning to play an instrument or just listen to it
                wether your favotite type of music like jazz rock 'n roll or kpop we will not jugde you we are here to help you find your sound
            </p>
